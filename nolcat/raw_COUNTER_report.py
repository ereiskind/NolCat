class RawCOUNTERReport:
    """A class for holding and processing raw COUNTER reports.
    
    This class takes a dataframe made from a R4 report CSV converted with the supplied JSONs or a R5 report harvested via SUSHI and handles its processing.
    
    Attributes:
        self.report_dataframe (dataframe): the raw COUNTER report as a pandas dataframe
    
    Methods:
        perform_deduplication_matching: Matches the line items in a COUNTER report for the same resource.
        harvest_SUSHI_report: Use the SUSHI API to collect all the master R5 reports from a given source for a set time period.
        #ToDo: Repeatedly running harvest_SUSHI_report with a list of credentials applying multithreading will be its own function/class
        load_data_into_database: Add the COUNTER report to the database by adding records to the Resource, Provided_Resources, and COUNTER_Usage_Data relations.
    
    Note:
        In all methods, the dataframe appears in the parameters list as `self`, but to use pandas functionality, it must be referenced as `self.report_dataframe`.
