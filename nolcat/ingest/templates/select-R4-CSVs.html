    <h1>Initialize the Database with R4 Data</h1>
    <p>The relational database is created containing the historical R4 data. In creating the database with all the R4 data, you cna be sure that the historical COUNTER data is in the new system and that R5 reports collected via SUSHI will have a solid foundation for deduplication.</p>

    <h2>1. Reformat the R4 Reports with OpenRefine</h2>
    <p>The crosstab format of R4 reports doesn't work well in relational databases; they need to be unpacked. JSONs <!--available where?--> contain the OpenRefine procedure for unpacking standard tabular R4 reports for use in this relational database. OpenRefine, an open source data cleanup tool, can be <a href="https://openrefine.org/download.html">downloaded here</a>. To make uploading the files easier, the OpenRefine results should be saved as CSVs to a single folder that contains no other files and has no subfolders.</p>

    <h2>2. Upload the Reformatted R4 Reports</h2>

    <p>a file selection field that supports selecting multiple files that goes to determine_if_resources_match when submitted</p>
