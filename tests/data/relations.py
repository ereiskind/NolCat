"""This module contains the dataframes representing the data used in the relations for testing. This data isn't stored in a tabular file to prevent file format change problems, especially encoding problems, from adding complications to the test. Having this data in a tabular format, however, is still needed; since fixtures cannot be called directly, a file with the dataframes imported by both the fixture functions and TSV creation function was created instead."""
