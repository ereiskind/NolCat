"""This module contains the dataframes representing the data from the sample COUNTER reports. This data isn't stored in a tabular file to prevent file format change problems, especially encoding problems, from adding complications to the test. Keeping this data in a separate module, however, makes the test modules easier to handle and makes it possible for this data to be output to TSVs in the same manner as the relation data used for testing."""
