The COUNTER Standard
********************

Metric Types in R4 and R5
=========================

COUNTER underwent a paradigm shift from R4 to R5, so usage from the two generations of the standard shouldn't be directly compared; all COUNTER data, however, is stored in the same relation. Usage from the two generations is separated by the  different metric types used.
